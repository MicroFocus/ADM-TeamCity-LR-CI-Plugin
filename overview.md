# LoadRunner Professional CI Test

As more software companies utilize continuous integration practices, you may also need to integrate load tests into your build process. This integration helps developers insure that new builds do not introduce regressions.

The LoadRunner plugin for the TeamCity provides a mechanism for executing Controller scenarios as part of a build configuration. This plugin allows you to trigger a performance test as a build step and view the results in TeamCity reports.
